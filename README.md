the language is `deez-blah` with the extension `dbl`

it's a lightweight compiler for my tiny programming language

it compiles to `masm` 32-bit

## TODO

create the compiler in cpp

make possible deps relative to project

## deps

the current dependencies are `crinkler` and `masm32`

the first in the path

the second in the `C:\` root folder

and the `masm32\bin` folder in the path with `ml.exe`

## disclaimers

the current `.cmd` build script considers the `SDK` version of your system
make sure it matches

## inspiration

`PlummersSoftwareLLC/HelloAssembly`

`orosmatthew/hydrogen-cpp`
